# Project Structure
The KangoJS codebase is managed using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) which means that the codebase
is a monorepo containing all KangoJS packages (found in `./packages/`).  

The main package `@kangojs/core` provides the core framework functionality and other packages add additional features.
