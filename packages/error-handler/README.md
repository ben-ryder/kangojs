## ⚠️ PACKAGE DEPRECATED ⚠️
This packages functionality has been moved to the core package [`@kangojs/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kangojs/core).

## 🤔 About
This package provides a way to centrally handle errors in your Express application.

⚠️ **This package is under development and isn't stable. I'm still testing and refining it right now so interfaces and functionality may change at any time.**

## 💥 Features
- Easily add global error handling middleware with `useErrorHandlerMiddleware`.
- Keep HTTP logic isolated by throwing generic errors in your services and mapping them to HTTP responses in the error handler.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Install the npm package:
```shell
npm install @kangojs/error-handler
```

## 👷 Usage
Documentation will be written once features and interfaces are stable and I make a v1.0 release
